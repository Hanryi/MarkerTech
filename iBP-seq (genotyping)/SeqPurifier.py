# [*BP]: a string option (BP or mBP or iBP)
# <bc.txt>: file containing 8bp barcodes
# <_1.fq>: clean data of forward sequencing
# <_2.fq>: clean data of reverse sequencing
# <o_fq.d>: directory for storing pair of fq which removed additional seq
# <o_umi.d>: (optional)
#            directory for storing fq which contains only UMI fragments

@Function
1. Divide mixed sequencing data to several pairs of fq by barcode and bridge
2. Separate UMI sequence in reads from genome sequence
